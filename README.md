# Algorithms-Python3-Implementations
This repository contains various algorithms and data structures implemented in Python. The structure of the repository is organized into two main categories: Algorithms and Data Structures. The implementations are based on the algorithms and data structures described in the book "Algorithms, Part I, Fourth Edition" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, Princeton University.

## Data Structures

Collections:

- Binary Heap: Implementation of a Binary Heap.
- Deque: Implementation of a Deque.
- Queue: Implementation of a Queue.
- Randomized Queue: Implementation of a Randomized Queue.
- Stack: Implementation of a Stack.
- Union Find: Implementation of Union-Find data structure.

Trees:

- BST: Implementation of a Binary Search Tree.
- Kd-Tree: Implementation of a KD-Tree.
- Red-Black BST: Implementation of a Red-Black Binary Search Tree.


## Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms:

- Dijkstra 3-Way Partition: Implementation of Dijkstra's 3-way partitioning algorithm.
- Heap Sort: Implementation of Heap Sort.
- Insertion Sort: Implementation of Insertion Sort.
- Merge Sort: Implementation of Merge Sort.
- Merge Sort Bottom-Up: Implementation of Bottom-Up Merge Sort.
- Merge Sort Improved: Improved version of Merge Sort.
- Quick Sort: Implementation of Quick Sort.
- Quick Sort Improved: Improved version of Quick Sort.
- Selection Sort: Implementation of Selection Sort.
- Shell Sort: Implementation of Shell Sort.


Other Algorithms:
